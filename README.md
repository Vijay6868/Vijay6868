## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
From a young age, I have been enthusiastic about computers and often wondered how software works, aspiring to create my own. My curiosity led me to discover programming languages, which ignited my motivation for self-study. With the assistance of a developer, I began learning and practicing C programming. Over time, I realized that software engineering was my true calling, prompting me to enroll in the Bachelor of Computing Systems program at Unitec, where I am currently in my final year.

My passion extends beyond software development to encompass Data and AI. Recently, I have earned certifications as an Azure Data Engineer and an AI Engineer Associate. Additionally, I dedicate my Fridays to volunteering as a Service Desk Analyst for a local community organization, gaining practical experience and contributing to my community.
